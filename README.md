# LibraryManagmentSystem
System that allows a user to checkout and return library books, and creates recommendations for them based on what books they have previously read.

This project was coursework for my Computer Science degree at Loughborough University. I recieved a first (95%) for it.

The user can search through the database of books (stored in a .txt file) and also filter their search.

The user can return any checked out books from the library, and check out any available books.

The user can get book recommendations for any member (new or existing) in the system. If the member is new, it will recommend the most popular books for their preferred genre; otherwise, it will figure out their favourite genre based on previous reads and recommend them books from the same genre that they have not read.
